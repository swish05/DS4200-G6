    <h1> NBA Player Stats Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating 
      individual contributions and their overall impact on the game. This
     analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard 
      to explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. 
     These statistics serve as critical indicators of player efficiency, influencing 
     decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike. </p>


    <p>Analyzing player performance metrics provides valuable insights into a player's 
     strengths and weaknesses, helping predict future performance and enabling 
      data-driven decisions regarding player contracts, trades, and team compositions. 
      As professional sports increasingly embrace analytics, particularly in leagues 
     like the NBA, this project offers a deep dive into the world of sports analytics 
     by examining player performance through quantitative metrics.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our analysis makes use of a dataset from the NBA stats leaders, and it includes the 
        top-performing players across various categories such as points per game, assists, 
        rebounds, steals, and blocks starting from 2010 and after. This data contains 
       roughly 450 records and includes around 22 key attributes. The attributes are listed 
       in the following table:</p>
