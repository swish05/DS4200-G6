        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating individual contributions and their overall impact on the game. This analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard to explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. These statistics serve as critical indicators of player efficiency, influencing decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analyzing player performance metrics provides valuable insights into a player's strengths and weaknesses, helping predict future performance and enabling data-driven decisions regarding player contracts, trades, and team compositions. As professional sports increasingly embrace analytics, particularly in leagues like the NBA, this project offers a deep dive into the world of sports analytics by examining player performance through quantitative metrics.

        <h2>Introduction to the Data</h2>
        <p>
            Our analysis makes use of a dataset from the NBA stats leaders, and it includes the top-performing players across various categories such as points per game, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks starting from 2010 and after. This data contains roughly 450 records and includes around 22 key attributes. The attributes are listed in the following table:

        <h3>Correlation Heatmap of Player Metrics and Draft Data</h3>
        <div id="heatmap"></div>
        <p>
            This correlation heatmap reveals several key relationships amongst the basketball player metrics and draft data. Players with better physical attributes, such as height and weight, are more likely to be drafted earlier, which can be seen by the strong negative correlations between player_height and draft_number (r = -0.54) and between player_weight and draft_round (r = -0.62). Offensive performance metrics, such as points per game (pts) and usage percentage (usg_pct), also show a strong positive correlation (r = 0.69), indicating that players with higher usage rates tend to score more points.
        </p>

        <h3>Shooting Efficiency by Draft Round</h3>
        <div id="shootingEfficiency"></div>
        <p>
            The box plot shows the relationship between draft round and shooting efficiency (true shooting percentage ==> ts_pct), revealing that players drafted in earlier rounds generally have higher shooting percentages and greater variability in performance. Earlier rounds exhibit a broad range of efficiencies, with many outliers suggesting that some players significantly outperform or underperform expectations.
        </p>

        <h3>Average Points Scored by Players for Each Team</h3>
        <div id="averagePoints"></div>
        <p>
            The interactive bar chart displays the average points scored by players for each team, showing comparisons of scoring performance across all NBA teams. The hover functionality allows users to view precise average points for each team to two decimal places, making it easier to compare team data efficiently.
