    <h1> NBA Player Stats Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding NBA player performance is essential for evaluating individual contributions and their overall impact on the game. This analysis uses statistical data from the official NBA website's leaderboard to explore key performance metrics such as points, assists, and rebounds. These statistics serve as critical indicators of player efficiency, influencing decisions made by fans, analysts, and team managers alike.
    </p>
    <p>
        Analyzing player performance metrics provides valuable insights into a player's strengths and weaknesses, helping predict future performance and enabling data-driven decisions regarding player contracts, trades, and team compositions. As professional sports increasingly embrace analytics, particularly in leagues like the NBA, this project offers a deep dive into the world of sports analytics by examining player performance through quantitative metrics.

    <h3>Introduction to the Data</h3>
    <p>
        Our analysis makes use of a dataset from the NBA stats leaders, and it includes the top-performing players across various categories such as points per game, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks starting from 2010 and after. This data contains roughly 450 records and includes around 22 key attributes. The attributes are listed in the following table:
